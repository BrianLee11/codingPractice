# 🌱 Flask Overview

This README provides a concise introduction to **Flask**, a lightweight and flexible web framework for building web applications in Python.

## ❓ What is Flask?

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) is a **micro web framework** written in Python. It’s designed to be simple, unopinionated, and easy to get started with, making it a popular choice for:

- APIs
- Microservices
- Prototypes and MVPs
- Lightweight web apps

Unlike more heavyweight frameworks (like Django), Flask gives you full control over your project architecture.
